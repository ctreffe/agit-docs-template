# Environment Troubleshooting

This registry belongs only to focused problem resolution. It stores portable
observed problems, confirmed causes, safe diagnostics and verified durable
repairs. It may retain an unresolved incident as an open task with the smallest
next diagnostic step. Do not read or update it after a quick exit. Host-specific
facts belong in ignored
`TROUBLESHOOTING.local.md`; secrets do not belong in either file.

Reuse an entry only when both its stable signature and applicability match and
its diagnostic reconfirms the cause. Otherwise diagnose anew. A recorded repair
does not grant protected authority.

## Entry Schema

Every entry records:

- **Stable signature:** Output and execution stage that distinguish the issue.
- **Applicability:** Platforms, runners, repositories or prerequisites in scope.
- **Cause:** The verified root cause, not a symptom or guess.
- **Safe diagnostic:** Bounded read-only evidence that confirms or rejects it.
- **Durable repair:** The preferred recovery and its security boundary.
- **Authorization needs:** Every approval or control-word requirement.
- **Verification:** The normal operation that must succeed before resumption.
- **Last confirmed:** ISO date and sanitized evidence scope.
- **Unresolved marker:** Only when no repair was verified; retain the problem as
  an open task and state the smallest next diagnostic step.

## Known Issues

## KI-0001: Windows sandbox Git ownership check blocks a repository

- **Stable signature:** Normal Git stops with `fatal: detected dubious ownership
  in repository` under a Windows sandbox identity different from the owner.
- **Applicability:** Native Windows Codex tasks where filesystem policy already
  permits the repository and Git uses the maintainer's global configuration.
  Filesystem setup failure is separate.
- **Cause:** Git independently protects repositories owned by another identity;
  active-workspace command trust does not automatically cover siblings.
- **Safe diagnostic:** Inspect `git config --show-origin --show-scope --get-all
  safe.directory`. For an exact authorized path, retry only the failed read-only
  query with `git -c safe.directory=<absolute-repository> status`. Success
  confirms missing ownership trust; it is not a repair.
- **Durable repair:** With explicit approval for persistent user-level Git trust,
  add only each intended absolute path with `git config --global --add
  safe.directory <absolute-repository>`. A coordinator may generate exact paths
  from its registry. Never use `safe.directory=*`, system-level trust or
  automatic derived-project inclusion.
- **Authorization needs:** This security relaxation needs approval. It grants no
  source or filesystem access and changes no rendering, disclosure, publication
  or Git authority.
- **Verification:** Run normal `git status` in every intended repository without
  `-c safe.directory`; verify writes only at an independently authorized write
  checkpoint.
- **Last confirmed:** 2026-09-07, sanitized native-Windows family evidence;
  seven exact current-user entries allowed normal status in Governance and all
  six source templates without a trust override.

## KI-0004: Context-sensitive patch application rejects a coordinated edit

- **Stable signature:** `apply_patch` rejects an edit with
  `verification failed: Failed to find expected lines` before reporting any
  changed file. A retry using freshly read exact context and smaller independent
  hunks succeeds.
- **Applicability:** Context-based repository patches, especially coordinated
  multi-file edits and line-wrapped Markdown where a generated hunk reconstructs
  or approximates surrounding text instead of copying the current target span.
  The same signature may follow a concurrent edit, different indentation or
  line wrapping; it is not by itself evidence of whitespace or line-ending
  damage.
  Dynamically assembled patch text can produce the same rejection when inserted
  lines lose their line-level operation markers.
- **Cause:** `apply_patch` verifies each hunk against exact current context. In
  the confirmed Governance incident, the failed hunk expected a shortened
  phrase at a line boundary that did not match the actual sentence. Because the
  combined patch was rejected as one operation, none of its otherwise valid
  hunks changed a file. The mismatch was generated patch context, not verified
  repository whitespace corruption.
  During the family rollout, one dynamically assembled insertion likewise lost
  its add-operation markers and was rejected atomically before changing a file.
- **Safe diagnostic:** Do not retry the same patch. Read only the bounded target
  span named in the failure, compare its exact wording and indentation with the
  rejected hunk, and inspect the affected repositories read-only to confirm
  whether any partial edit occurred. Distinguish stale or approximated context
  from malformed line-level operation markers and actual line-ending or
  whitespace evidence before selecting a repair.
- **Durable repair:** Before the first complex patch, read the exact target
  spans and build hunks around the smallest stable semantic anchors. Separate
  independent files or uncertain hunks so one context mismatch does not reject
  a broad coordinated edit. When assembling patch text dynamically, preserve an
  explicit operation marker on every hunk line. For repeated family changes,
  prove the hunk on one representative file, then apply the same verified shape
  to matching copies.
  After any rejection, verify atomicity and correct only the mismatched hunk;
  do not broaden the context or attribute the failure to whitespace by default.
- **Authorization needs:** Read-only context and state inspection need no new
  authority inside the active repository scope. Resulting edits retain all
  source, rendering, disclosure, publication and Git boundaries.
- **Verification:** On a natural coordinated multi-file edit, read the exact
  spans before constructing the first patch, apply the bounded hunks through
  the normal `apply_patch` path and inspect the resulting diff. Success
  requires first-attempt application with only the intended files changed; do
  not create a fix-specific fixture or substitute patch test.
- **Last confirmed:** 2026-09-06, coordinated Governance and six-source-template
  rollout. One normal multi-repository patch updated all seven freshly read
  `start-task` targets on its first attempt, and focused diffs showed only the
  intended skill changes. After the malformed generated insertion was diagnosed
  and rejected atomically, a later dynamically assembled seven-file handoff
  patch with explicit line markers also succeeded on its first attempt.

## KI-0005: Default sandbox blocks an authorized Git metadata write

- **Stable signature:** An authorized `git add -- <exact paths>` or `git commit`
  starts in the default `workspace-write` sandbox and fails because Git cannot
  create `.git/index.lock`. Read-only Git inspection succeeds, no partial
  index state is observed, and the same exact write succeeds when separately
  approved to run outside the sandbox.
- **Applicability:** Codex local command execution with a writable repository
  root under the default `workspace-write` policy. The protection also applies
  when `.git` is a pointer file and Git resolves metadata elsewhere.
- **Cause:** Codex deliberately protects every writable root's `.git` path
  recursively as read-only. Creating `index.lock` is the normal first step for
  an index write, so this denial is an expected sandbox boundary, not evidence
  of a stale lock, repository ACL defect or transient Git failure.
- **Safe diagnostic:** Do not repeat the write in the sandbox. Preserve the
  current selection, inspect status and staged paths read-only, distinguish
  failure to create `index.lock` from an already-existing lock, and confirm
  that no partial index change occurred. Investigate an existing lock or a
  failure outside the sandbox as a different incident.
- **Durable repair:** Once exact staging is requested or the corresponding
  commit is authorized, request each exact Git command that writes `.git`
  through the platform's narrow sandbox escalation on its first attempt. Keep
  read-only Git inspection sandboxed. Do not add `.git` to writable roots,
  change ACLs or ownership, delete a lock, enable full access, or install a
  persistent allow rule. Escalation changes only the execution boundary and
  grants no additional source, rendering, disclosure, publication,
  path-selection, push or standing authority.
- **Authorization needs:** Staging requires its normal concrete request or the
  authorization of the corresponding commit. Commits and other protected Git
  actions retain every repository-specific control-word requirement. The
  platform's narrowly scoped sandbox approval is separate from both.
- **Verification:** At the next natural authorized staging or commit, run the
  exact metadata-writing command outside the sandbox on its first attempt, then
  verify the intended staged paths, index state and absence of a residual lock
  through the normal workflow. Do not create a fix-specific repository or
  substitute index test.
- **Last confirmed:** 2026-09-07, official Codex protected-path documentation,
  the active `workspace-write` permission boundary and recurring sanitized
  derived-project reports matched the signature. The seven-repository
  instruction rollout received focused source and diff review.
- **Unresolved marker:** Runtime acceptance remains open until the next natural
  authorized staging or commit completes through the first-attempt escalation
  path without a preceding sandbox denial.
