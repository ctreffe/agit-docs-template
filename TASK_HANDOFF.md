# Task Handoff

- Status: ready for authorized follow-up commit
- Outcome: Documentation-project initialization now replaces inherited
  template maintenance entries in `CHANGELOG.md` and `TASK_HANDOFF.md` with
  project-owned state, and
  ordinary commit preparation reinduces exact direct prefixes and meaningful
  bodies.
- Decisions: Preserve source-template lineage in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Perform
  the reset only after successful setup and preserve rendering, review,
  publication and existing-project boundaries.
- Changed files: commit, creation and initialization skills; `REPOSITORY.md`;
  `PROJECT_SETUP.md`; changelog; and this handoff.
- Checks: The targeted production skill validator and `git diff --check` pass.
  At commit preparation the complete Family gate must pass once after this
  final handoff update.
- Preserved unrelated state: The amended predecessor commit retains its
  original tree. Existing derived projects were not inspected or changed, and
  push remains unauthorized.
- Open points: Observe future initialized projects for clean project-owned
  history and retain the later retrospective-transfer behavioral follow-up.
- Next step: Create and verify the separately authorized follow-up commit after
  the Family gate; do not push.
